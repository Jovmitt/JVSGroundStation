# JVSGroundStation
Ground Station tool made to be used with t16km flight stick and arduino uno with irx4+ transmitter attached. Still not complete. Use and modify it to use other joysticks/flight sticks at your own risk.

You MUST have a 2s lipo (7.4v) feeding the transmitter and arduino in order to everything work properly.
